# UGCC Sharing
When defining UGCC via the [xAPI](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI.md), `actors` can **share** UGCC, where UGCC is a some user generated content related to a course. This directory defines the [vocabulary](vocab.md) and provides [examples](#resources) of the best practices defined by this CoP for UGCC Sharing.

Note that the `object.id` should be a URL addressing the UGCC. The UGCC may also be uploaded via a [xAPI Activity Profile](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI.md#75-activity-profile-api), this is recommended in cases where the service that currently hosts the UGCC may cease to exist in the future.
